This is a separate GRE Vocab Study Flashcard that I made using javascript. 
It mainly contains a javascript file, an html and a css file.
It contains The GRE vocab words according to their groups i.e. 30 words per group. 
It shows the word first and if you want to know the meaning then you can simply click on the word or simply hit 'Space' or 'Enter' key. It also shows you an example to help you retain what you learn much effectively.
If you want to use this flashcard, then you can simply clone this repo in your system then inside the flashcards-server, you have to run node server.js on your terminal which opens a local host for you. Then you can simply click on the index.html file to use this on a website.
